My configuration files from vim, bash, git ... if you find them useful, use them as you please

... and I also added here few bash scripts I written for syncing my data (so I have them in one place)

update: 

   *   this files might be old, I'm not using this repository anymore
   *   I'm using slightly costumized Janus Vim version , not my vim any more 

...but still If you find anything helpfull, use it
